    <p>Losing weight starts with a healthy diet, but incorporating fitness is also an important part of the equation.<br>
    Exercise can increase your calorie budget, giving you more room to enjoy healthy snacks throughout the day, and is also an important part of maintaining your overall health.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Anna, and this is my food blog. I love cooking. I love eating even more. It seems that wherever I go recipes jump out at me and this blog is my place to record them. They are usually quick and simple, mostly seasonal and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and I do.</p>
