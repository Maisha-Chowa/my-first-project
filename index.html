            <p>
              Losing weight starts with a healthy diet, but incorporating fitness is
              also an important part of the equation.<br />
              Exercise can increase your calorie budget, giving you more room to enjoy
              healthy snacks throughout the day, and is also an important part of
              maintaining your overall health.

            <p>
              Hi, Iâ€™m Anna, and this is my food blog. I love cooking. I love eating
              even more. It seems that wherever I go recipes jump out at me and this
              blog is my place to record them. They are usually quick and simple,
              mostly seasonal and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as much as
              my family and I do.
            </p>
