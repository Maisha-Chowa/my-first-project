          Losing weight starts with a healthy diet, but incorporating fitness is
          also an important part of the equation.<br />
          Exercise can increase your calorie budget, giving you more room to
          enjoy healthy snacks throughout the day, and is also an important part
          of maintaining your overall health.

        <p>
          Hi, I’m Anna, and this is my food blog. I love cooking. I love eating
          even more. It seems that wherever I go recipes jump out at me and this
          blog is my place to record them. They are usually quick and simple,
          mostly seasonal and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as much as
          my family and I do.
